This repository collects scripts, tools, manifests and documentations, provides home for [Apache ShardingSphere](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/) on cloud solutions.

Solutions currently included in this project:

* [The ShardingSphere-Operator](https://github.com/SphereEx/shardingsphere-on-cloud/tree/main/shardingsphere-operator)

The ShardingSphere operator uses predefined CustomResourceDefinitions for describing a Deployment for Apache ShardingSphere on Kubernetes.


## ShardingSphere Operator
### Prerequisites

With the help of ShardingSphere-Operator you could create a ShardingSphere-Proxy cluster including the ZooKeeper cluster in minutes.

For installation of SharingSphere-Operator, you will need a Kubernetes cluster, no matter it is a managed Kubernetes service like AWS EKS or self-hosted Kubernetes, or just a mini-kube, you can easily install ShardingSphere-Operator with respective [ShardingSphere Operator Helm Charts](https://github.com/SphereEx/shardingsphere-on-cloud/tree/main/charts/shardingsphere-cluster), and apply the manifests in [ShardingSphere Cluster Helm Charts](https://github.com/SphereEx/shardingsphere-on-cloud/tree/main/charts/shardingsphere-cluster) describing the expected Apache ShardingSphere deployment. **Kubernetes 1.18+ is recommended**.
